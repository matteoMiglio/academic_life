# AcademicLife

AcademicLife is a web application that aims to improve the quality and the service of the classes at the University of Ferrara. The main goal of this app is to connect students and let them exchange information and materials on the classes they are following.

AcademicLife is designed to be integrated with other services that are already used at the University.

## ðŸ¥… Purpose of this project

This project was developed for a practical exam in the degree course of Computer Engineering.
It's not a ready-to-use project. It was created as a proof of concept to promote the idea behind this application.

This project also participated in a contest inside the course of Computer Engineering.

## ðŸ›  Development Method

We were a team of three guys and we approached the development using the Test-Driven Development (TDD).

## ðŸ’¡ Functionalities
Every student subscribed at the University of Ferrara would enjoy these functionalities:

* He/She can watch the classes present in his/her study plan. For each course there is the average of the marks and the reviews made by other students;

* A bulletin board is associated with each course of study. The students that are enrolled in that course can use it to publish posts, comments, create study groups, and share documents;

* In each group there are three types of users:
  * the admin: who can create the groups and he's the only one who can manage the group;
  * the member: who accepted the invitation and is effectively a member of the group;
  * the invited: who received an invitation;

* In each group, there is the possibility to schedule events. An event aims to organize a group of students to study together;

* Each student has their notifications to stay updated on group invitations, events scheduled or new comments where he/she is involved.
